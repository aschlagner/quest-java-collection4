Challenge: Avengers: Pre-Sequel Part 2

Thanos finally became a fan of the Avengers and decided, after more or less resurrecting them, to use his Infinity Glove to throw a party.

In order to impress the gallery, he wants to offer each guest his favourite flower!

To get started, make a Fork of the following deposit then clone it locally.

    Be sure to do a Fork or you won't be able to grow anything!

Thanos has elements Hero and Flower:

    Building a TreeMap named party with key Hero and value Flower.

    Add to party the following key/value pairs:

        Hulk, Thor and Scarlet Witch have a Rose
        Vision have a Tulip
        Captain America have a Lily
        Doctor Strange and Black Widow have a Violet

    In one line, display whether party contains the instance begonia.

    Browse the associative array in alphabetical order of hero names, and display, for each of them, its assigned flower.
